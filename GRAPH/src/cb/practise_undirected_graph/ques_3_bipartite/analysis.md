# Bipartite Graph Definition
    - A Bipartite Graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two independent sets, U and V such that every edge (u, v)
      either connects a vertex from U to V or a vertex from V to U. 
    - In other words, for every edge (u, v), either u belongs to U and v to V, or u belongs to V and v to U. 
      We can also say that there is no edge that connects vertices of same set.
 
   

Ques-1: Can a tree be converted to bipartite graph ?
        Wonderfull question must check video

Ques-2: If there is cycle of odd length can it be bipartite ?


Condition: If there is a cycle, cycle cannot be of odd length

NOTE: Here colouring concept is very wonderful it tells you if no. of node is odd or even in cycle









NOTE: Tree does not have cycle
